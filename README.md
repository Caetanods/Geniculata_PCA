**Abstract:**
Male genitalia are among the fastest evolving structures, but the modes of evolution of female genitalia are still subject of debate. Studies at various levels have show that female genitalia may either evolve independently or coevolve with male genitalia, but the latter seems prevalent when the traits are functionally connected. However, an intriguing and yet unexplored question is in which rates male and female genitalia change in a coevolutionary scenario. Using comparative phylogenetic methods we uncovered an intersexual coevolutionary dynamics in a clade of stink bugs and investigated in which rates each genitalia change over time. We also compared the rates between genitalia and three somatic characters frequently used in species-level phylogenies and studies on species delimitation. Both genitalia evolve much faster than all somatic traits, and female genitalia evolves approximately twice slower than male genitalia. This disparity suggests that male genitalia is probably the primary subject to selection, and female genitalia appears to be changing in response to provide a tight fit of the genitalia during copula. The observed patterns of covariation between the genitalia are more consistent with a cooperative fit expected under female choice or lock-and-key, but alternative mechanisms are also discussed.
